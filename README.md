# FREE Sensor
_"Wildfires have changed, It's time the technology to fight them does too."_

FREE Sensor is a device firefighters use to detect harmful gasses and to track status of individual firefighters.

## IBM Cloud services

`IBM Watson IoT Platform` for streaming IoT data and managing IoT devices  
`Cloudant` database for storing history IoT data  
`IBM Watson Studio / Data refinery` for data transformation and parsing  
`IBM Watson Studio / Cognos Dashboard` for data visualization and analytics  

## Getting Started

Follow this [tutorial](https://developer.ibm.com/recipes/tutorials/run-an-esp8266arduino-as-a-iot-foundation-managed-device/) to connect ESP8266 with the IoT platform. For current setup, on the IBM Watson IoT Platform, change `Default Rule` in `Security` to `TLS Optional` to connect with ESP.

To setup history database for IoT data, go to `Extensions` > `Histroical Data Storage` and choose the `Cloudant` service you have created.

Open `IBM Watson Studio` to get access to the database and add connection.

Please message [Taylor](rainbowwww5@gmail.com) to be added to the Watson Studio project.

## Prototyping

Our early prototyping consisted of taking individual sensor components and producing a serial communication readout of the live data. We used the NodeMCU controller to drive the other sensors.

One major setback we faced was the original CO sensor we used. The sensor die had an operating temperature of over 100Â°C. This was a massive drain on our battery, and ultimately the bottleneck in miniturizing our device. Thankfully, we found an alternative sensor that has an extremely low-power profile and rated to remain opperational for nearly ten years. This significantly freed up constraints on how small and light our device could become.
Once we tested all the sensors and had their output saving accurately, we combined their output into a test .csv to feed into the IBM cloud. Once on the cloud, we could start analyzing and visualizing the data using IBM computing services. This allowed us to produce remarkable information from our sensor data.
