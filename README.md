# FREE Sensor

FREE Sensor is a device firefighters use to detect harmful gasses and to track status of individual firefighters. 

## Getting Started

Setup IBM cloud database access:
    `pip3 install ibm_db`
Go to IBM Cloud and create a db2 

Current version is using the IBM Db2 on Cloud feature. 
Create a Db2 service by selecting `Resources` > `Create resource` > search for `Db2`. 
For future project might consider `Db2 Warehouse` for data analyitics. For now we are using the free version which comes with 200 MB of data storage for testing.

Please message Taylor to get credentials for the Db2 on cloud otherwise you won't be able to run the code.

### Prerequisites

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system
